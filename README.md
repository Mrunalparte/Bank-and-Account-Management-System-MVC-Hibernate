# Bank-and-Account-Management-System-MVC-Hibernate

Type- One to many | Kind – Uni Directional

Developed a comprehensive system for managing banks and associated accounts, enabling efficient organization and manipulation of financial data using Object – Relational Mapping.
Designed and implemented a modular Controller class to handle core logic for adding, updating, and deleting banks and accounts.
Developed methods for fetching and displaying details of banks and accounts in an organized manner.
Provided options to update individual account details, such as name, account number, balance, and phone number.

In the dynamic landscape of banking and financial services, effective management of customer accounts is crucial. A Bank and Account Management System utilizing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, coupled with Hibernate for data persistence, provides a robust and scalable solution for handling customer accounts, transactions, and other related functionalities.

1. Purpose of the System:
The primary objective of the Bank and Account Management System is to facilitate efficient management of customer accounts, transactions, and related financial activities. It serves as a centralized platform for banks to handle various aspects such as account creation, transaction processing, and account updates.

2. Architecture Overview:
2.1 Model-View-Controller (MVC):
Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. This includes classes for managing customer accounts, transactions, and related data. Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is used to interact with the database for data persistence.

View: Deals with the presentation and user interface. It displays information retrieved from the model and sends user inputs back to the controller. Views in our system will include interfaces for account management, transaction history, and customer details.

Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It processes user inputs, updates the model, and refreshes the view accordingly. Controllers in our system will handle account creation, transaction processing, and customer information updates.

2.2 Hibernate:
Hibernate is an ORM framework that simplifies the interaction between Java applications and relational databases. It maps Java objects to database tables, reducing the need for complex SQL queries and providing a more object-oriented approach to database operations.

Entity Mapping: Utilize Hibernate annotations or XML configurations to map Java entities (e.g., Customer, Account) to corresponding database tables.

Transaction Management: Hibernate handles transactions, ensuring data consistency and integrity during database operations.

Query Language: Hibernate Query Language (HQL) or Criteria API can be used to perform database queries in a more object-oriented manner.

3. Key Features:
Account Management: Create, update, and delete customer accounts with associated details such as account type, balance, and account status.

Transaction Processing: Record and manage transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts.

Customer Information: Maintain and update customer details, including personal information, contact details, and account-related preferences.

Data Persistence: Utilize Hibernate to seamlessly interact with a relational database, ensuring data is stored and retrieved efficiently.

Security: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive customer information.

4. Benefits:
Scalability: Designed with scalability in mind, the system can handle a growing number of accounts and transactions.

Data Integrity: Hibernate simplifies database interactions, reducing the risk of data inconsistency and improving overall data integrity.

Maintainability: MVC architecture promotes a modular and maintainable codebase, making it easier to update or extend functionalities.

User Experience: Provide a user-friendly interface for customers and bank employees to interact with the system seamlessly.

In conclusion, the Bank and Account Management System with MVC and Hibernate offers a comprehensive solution for banks to manage customer accounts and financial transactions efficiently. This system integrates the benefits of MVC architecture for a well-structured application and Hibernate for simplified and reliable data persistence.
